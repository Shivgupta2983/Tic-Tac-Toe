## Game Logic

The JavaScript code implements the core game logic, including:

*   **AI Strategy**: The computer AI uses a `getFirstWithTwoInARow` function to find the best move. The AI will try to win first or block the player from winning.
*   **Win Condition Check**: The `checkWin` function determines if there is a winner by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
*   **Grid Management**: The `Grid` object manages the state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
*   **Turn Management**: The `cellClicked` and `makeComputerMove` functions manage the turns of the player and the computer.

## Code Structure

*   `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game, including the game board, buttons, and modal.
*   `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the game, including the layout, colors, and fonts.
*   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the game logic and user interface.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following:

*   **CSS styles**: Change the colors, fonts, and layout of the game by editing the `styles.css` file.
*   **AI difficulty**: Adjust the AI difficulty by modifying the `makeComputerMove` function in the `script.js` file.
*   **Game messages**: Change the game messages by modifying the text in the `index.html` file.

## Future Enhancements
